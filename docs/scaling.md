Scaling means increasing or decreasing the number of replicas of an application component.

You could scale your Pod to 2, 3, or 10 replicas.

The benefits of this are twofold:

    High availability: if one of the Pods crashes, there are still other replicas running that can handle incoming requests
    Resiliency: the total traffic to your application is distributed between all the replicas. Thus, the risk of overload of a single Pod is reduced
